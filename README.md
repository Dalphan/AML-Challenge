# AML-Challenge
Repository for the challenge of Advanced Machine Learning class

The best submission on the public leaderboard can be replicated from the 88_3.ipynb notebook.
The second submission can be replicated from the 87_3.ipynb notebook.

The second approach has a simpler model architecture, without the final MLP block and skip connection. It adds noise and masking to the caption embedding, instead of the mixup approach of the first notebook.
